<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">W</span>elcome to my new site! My name is Cassandria Barlow-Mayfield.  I'm a classical concert pianist with a bachelors and a masters degree in piano performance from the University of Utah (read more <a href="https://pianobycassie.com/about/">about me</a>).  I have been performing for more than 35 years and teaching piano for more than 25 years. I have always been very passionate about music.</p>

The purpose of this site is to both educate and market my piano studio. I will begin posting every now and then about performance practice, practicing techniques, pieces that I am excited about, reviews of new pieces I find, and extra work and listening assignments that I'd like my students to complete, so check back often.

If you're interested in hiring me as an adjudicator, performer, accompanist, or are interested in taking lessons, please see my <a href="https://pianobycassie.com/services/">services page</a>.  Otherwise if you'd like more information about me, my studio, or current enrollment, please <a href="https://pianobycassie.com/contact/">contact me</a>.
