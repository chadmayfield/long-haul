        <p>Consider my services for adjudicating your competition or evaluation. I have experience in judging soloists and groups. I'm willing to travel up to 100+ miles.</p>

        <h2>Arrangements</h2>
        <p>If you are in need of a special arrangement for a performance or event, I am able to transpose or add accompaniment to the song of your choice. I can help you arrange a solo work and accompaniment in the range of your instrument or voice.</p>

        <h2>Instructor</h2>
        <p>I offer instruction to all ages and abilities, but require an audition and interview to determine skill level and compatibility.</p>

            <li>Ownership of an acoustic piano that is in good repair and tuning is very highly recommended.</li>
