        <p>I am conveniently located in Herriman, Utah, centrally located between Salt Lake and Utah counties. I offer a wide range of musical services, some of which include:

        <h2>Accompanist</h2>
        <p>I am a professionally trained and experienced accompanist and am available to collaborate with: solo instruments, small or large instrumental ensembles (including chamber music or orchestras), solo vocalists, and small or large vocal ensembles (including choirs). I'm experienced and comfortable with sight reading and am willing to travel up to 100+ miles.  <a href="https://pianobycassie.com/contact">Contact me</a> for rates.</p>

        <h2>Adjudicator</h2>
        <p>Consider my services for adjudicating your competition or evaluation. I have experience in judging soloists and groups. I'm willing to travel up to 100+ miles.</p>

        <h2>Arrangements</h2>
        <p>If you are in need of a special arrangement for a performance or event, I am able to transpose or add accompaniment to the song of your choice. I can help you arrange a solo work and accompaniment in the range of your instrument or voice.</p>

        <h2>Instructor</h2>
        <p>I offer instruction to all ages and abilities, but require an audition and interview to determine skill level and compatibility. Weekly lessons are offered at 30, 45, and 60 minute lengths. Monthly performance class attendance and bi-annual recital performances are required. Competitions and evaluations are encouraged, but not required. Ownership of an acoustic piano that is in good repair and tuning is very highly recommended. Currently, as of June 2018, my studio is full, but I'm always interested in meeting and listening to potential students and have a waiting list. <a href="https://pianobycassie.com/contact">Contact me</a> to schedule an audition.</p>

        <h2>Performer</h2>
        <p>I am a classical concert pianist trained to perform on stage as <a href="https://www.deseretnews.com/article/657456/Philharmonia-philharmonizes-magnificently-at-Assembly-Hall.html" target="_blank">a soloist</a> and as a collaborator. <a href="https://www.cityweekly.net/utah/midsummer-nightandrsquos-strings/Content?oid=2135390" target="_blank">Performing</a> is my true passion and as such I have a wide breadth of experience; from performing as a background musician (such as weddings and Christmas parties) to performing on large stages around the world (such as Abravanel Hall).</p>
